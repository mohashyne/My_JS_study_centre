# This is my JavaScript study style. Javascript for beginners. if you have any question regarding any module you don't understand you can contact me via twitter @muhammadsalyhu. i can even give you links to download Video guides.

# remember if you want to test any js codes in each module you need to link the script in the html e.g

<script src="js/01-console.js"></script>

//OR

//USE REPLIT.COM TO TEST IT.

you can see the name of the js linked to the html above as "js/01-console.js"

# OR you can link the app.js and copy each module to it for experiment.

# There is separate html file for don practice in the dom folder.

# VIDEO GUIDES AVAILABLE

# THIS IS HOW I WRITE MY CODES WHILE STUDYING. REMEMBER YOU CAN NOT USE THE TYPE OF COMMENTING IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.
